        An Introduction To Me
      </h2>
      <p>
        I always feel weird writing these things. I imagine it sounds like one of those loney heart adverts in the newspaper.
        <br>
        <br>
        My name is James Devall. I am an ordinary, boring and mundane human being. No superpowers or anything, at least I've not discovered them yet anyway.
        <br>
        <br>
        I am pushing 30 years old, I have children and a bucket load of responsibilities. The fact entropy is hard at work everyday plays on my mind. I was convinced I would be a millionaire by 20 but that must be in an alternative universe.
        <br>
        <br>
        To counteract the obvious fact I'm not special or magically endowed with the ability to conjure up anything I can imagine, I work really really hard and teach my self new skills as often as I can to give myself at least a fighting chance at being competitive. This website is a materialisation of that.

      <h2>
        What I Am Working Towards
      </h2>
      <p>
        Creating this website is me knuckling down and learning the skills that a younger and more naive me thought I didn't need. I tried selling WordPress websites with hosting and I even started a limited company. If you didn't get it from the framing of the statement, I failed, spectacularly. 
        <br>
        <br>
        My interests, fundamentally, lie in understanding how things work. Technology, psychology, philosophy, theology and the universe being some of my most prominent interests. Without trying to sound like a motivational note to myself, I've realised I have a talent for acquiring new skills regardless if it's practical or academic.
        <br>
        <br>
        Using my strategical thinking, I have decided that the best way for me to be satisfied with my work and be able to take care of my responsibilities is to work in an exciting emerging field. I plan to learn how to create different things on the Ethereum Blockchain and eventually Machine Learning/AI.
        <br>
        <br>
        I spent a good 12 months trying to become a quintillionaire in the forex markets. It didn't take me long to realise the odds were stacked heavily against me and the brokers are the only ones who really profit. Most of the time anyway. If you have the discipline and the patience you can multiply your net worth to ridiculous heights.
        <br>
        <br>
        I know I don't. I tried. Really hard. I kept making loads of money and then losing it all over and over again. It ended up as just another addition to my list of failures. My final judgement was that it was just ultimately too much for one person with responsibilities and commitments. A bot though? They might just stand a chance.
